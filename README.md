# Smart Valve Controller Project

(This is a personal learning project created independently in my own time.)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains two related embedded systems projects:
1. **Water Valve Controller**  
   Controls two solenoid valves based on AC power availability and coordinates with a pump controller via wireless communication. Includes backup battery failover for reliability.

2. **Gas Valve Controller**  
   Uses a non-contact liquid level sensor to detect low water levels in a container and shut down a gas line valve for safety.

Both systems are based on **ESP32 microcontrollers** and were developed as part of a learning/prototyping journey in embedded systems, power management, and IoT communication.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Automatic **AC/Battery failover** using a power-path controller.
- **Water valve switching** between primary (pump) and backup (gravity-fed) sources.
- **Wireless communication** between controllers for pump coordination.
- **Gas line shutoff** triggered by non-contact water level sensing.
- Status indicators for power availability and system readiness.
- Open-source design: schematics, PCB layouts, Gerbers, and firmware included.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `water-valve-controller/` â†’ Code, schematics, PCB & Gerbers for the water system.  
- `gas-valve-controller/` â†’ Code, schematics, PCB & Gerbers for the gas system.  
- `Images/` â†’ Prototype photos and diagrams.  
- `Docs/` â†’ Additional documentation and notes.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Flash the code in `Code/` to an ESP32-C6 or ESP32-S3 Mini.  
2. Assemble hardware as per the schematics.  
3. Power using 12V SMPS or 3S Li-ion battery pack.  
4. Test AC failover by toggling AC input and monitoring valve behavior.
